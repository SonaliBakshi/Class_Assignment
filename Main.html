        <b><i>Sports Academy :</i></b><br>Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,through casual or organised participation,
       aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases,
       entertainment for spectators. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of
        simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete,
        simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.
        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.
        Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a
         regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

     with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,
     and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical
      element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim
    recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge
    as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical
    sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be
     admitted as sports.</p><br><br>

    After a tough loss, Indian football team exited the AFC Asian Cup 2019 in the group stage after the tough 0-1 loss against Bahrain. Despite the negative result, there were some positives for the team. One man, though had a shocker. No surprises for guessing who he was. Our experts rate the performances of the night. (Video - India vs Bahrain match analysis by Ishfaq Ahmed)
    <br><br>
    GURPREET SINGH SANDHU 8/10<br>
    We would’ve given him full marks if he had held on to that final grounded ball from the left.<br>
    <br>
    SUBHASHISH BOSE 7/10<br>
Solid effort from a wingback who will be a part of India’s football setup for some time to come. <br>

SANDESH JHINGAN 8/10
Didn’t make a mistake all game. His best game of the tournament. Was superb in terms of positioning, a solid presence physically and showed great timing in the tackle.

ANAS EDATHODIKA NA
Subbed off due to injury in 2nd minutes of the game.

SALAM RANJAN SINGH 6/10
Might seem a bit harsh but he made a couple of crucial errors and had a role to play in the penalty that India ended up conceding. A decent effort, though, from the East Bengal central defender.

PRITAM KOTAL 6/10
Dealt pretty well with the relentless Bahrain wing play on the right. Nothing spectacular but also no major errors. He is another player who has cemented his spot in the side.

  <b><i>  The India women's national football team is controlled by the All India Football Federation and represents India in women's international football competitions. The women's team resumed playing on 7 September 2012 after nearly a year-long hiatus.[3] Under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and governed in Asia by the AFC, the team is also part of the South Asian Football Federation. The team was one of the best teams in Asia in the mid 70s to early 80s, when they became runners-up at 1979 and 1983 AFC Women's Asian Cup. Presently, the Indian team has won all the SAFF Women's Championship that they have participated in since 2010.

    The team has yet to participate in the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic Games, and failed to participate in the last 5 Asian Cups since 2003 at Thailand, as their last participation. Present ranking of the team according to FIFA Women's World Rankings is 57 and 13th among the Asian countries.

Afghanistan opened the scoring at the stroke of half-time through Zelfagar Nazary, but super-sub Seiminlen Doungel headed in his first goal for India to equalize in the 93rd minute as the spoils were shared.
spirited performance from the Indian football team helped them walk away with a 1-1 draw against Afghanistan in their FIFA 2022 World Cup qualifier at the Central Republic Stadium in Dushanbe on Thursday.

India were trailing 0-1 at the half-way mark after Zelfy Nazary put Afghanistan ahead in the 46th minute as he stormed into the box and smashed the ball past goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.

India created quite a few chances after being pushed on the backfoot and the efforts finally paid off in stoppage time when Seiminlen Doungel headed home a pin-point cross from the corner kick taken by Brandon Fernandes in the third minute of added time.

India looked to take on the opposition but they could not create any clear chances, and the couple of half chances in the opening minutes failed to test the Afghan custodian.

There was a change straightaway for India after the break as Stimac substituted Mandar with Farukh Choudhary.

The visitors showed urgency and looked desperate for an equaliser. They had a chance in the 58th minute but skipper Sunil Chhetri's header off a cross from right back Pritam Kotal was saved by Azizi. At the other end, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a diving save.

While he will be disappointed to end the match in a stalemate, Stimac's decision to bring in Doungel<br></p>

      <img src="C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Sports_Complex\News2.jpg" height="500" width="60%" align="left">When we were assessing Constantine’s squad for the Asian Cup we had specifically discussed Anas’ injury issues this season and felt it was a good call to have Subhashish and Narayan Das in the fray. In case of an injury, we assumed, Bose could move to central defence and Das has plenty of experience (including 29 caps) as left back. Instead of making this change, though, Constantine decided to play Salam Ranjan- who has not won too much playing time at the international level.

Though Salam did okay, the applecart was upset. At half time he chose to take Ashique — India’s most positive player against Bahrain — off and replace him with Jeje in another confounding move. Overall, he seems to have read the game poorly and, perhaps, preempted the inevitable by announcing his decision to leave India in the post match press conference.<br></p>
